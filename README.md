# Project-Green-Investing
This project will determine whether investing in renewable energy is profitable and low risk. The focus will be on comparing a Solar energy portfolio with the S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ. The analysis will look specifically at risk and returns to form a conclusion.

## Hypothesis of the project

Due to the commitments that the international community has made to tackle climate change and growing demand, industries in the Solar Energy sector have a higher potential to be more profitable in the long term
